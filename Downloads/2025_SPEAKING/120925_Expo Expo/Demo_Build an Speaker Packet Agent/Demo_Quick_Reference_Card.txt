## DEMO FLOW (8 minutes total)

### STEP 1: SETUP (2 min)
- Open Claude Code
- Create new project: "Speaker Packet Agent"
- Set scenario: "Speakers send chaos. What if AI handled it?"

### STEP 2: UPLOAD JANE SMITH PACKET (1 min)
- Show messy bio on screen (buzzwords, vague session description)
- Call out: "Dynamic thought leader. Leveraging synergies. This is a Mad Lib."
- Drag + drop file into Claude Code

### STEP 3: PASTE INSTRUCTIONS (2 min)
- Copy from Speaker_Content_Processor_Instructions.txt
- Paste into Claude Code
- Highlight key sections:
  - 3 bio formats
  - Session abstract + takeaways
  - Alt text
  - Quality checklist
  - BANNED WORDS (crowd favorite)
- Say: "That's the whole instruction set. Plain English."
- Hit Enter

### STEP 4: SHOW OUTPUT (3 min)
**Read aloud as it appears:**
- 50-word bio: "No buzzwords. Specific companies. Human detail."
- 1-sentence intro: "Speakable. Hand this to your emcee."
- Session abstract: "Tells attendees what they GET, not what speaker will 'share.'"
- Alt text: "WCAG compliant. Your reg system needs this."
- Quality checklist: "Agent is doing QA for you. Flags missing tech requirements."
- Export table: "Copy-paste straight into Cvent. No reformatting."

**Turn to room:** "That took 90 seconds. That is workflow automation."

### STEP 5: TEST LIVE (2 min)
- Ask room: "Shout out a speaker name and topic!"
- Upload Mike Chen packet (or adapt to whatever they shout)
- Agent processes faster (instructions already set)
- Point out: "Name mismatch flag—filename doesn't match speaker name. QA at 11pm."

**Turn to room:** "No babysitting. Just output."

## KEY TALKING POINTS

**When showing instructions:**
"No coding. Just clear English telling the AI what good work looks like."

**When output appears:**
"Same quality. Same format. Every time."

**When quality checklist appears:**
"The agent is flagging what's missing so you know exactly what follow-up emails to send."

**When showing second packet:**
"If I wanted to process 50 speakers? I upload 50 packets. Same result every time."

**Transition to Exercise 3:**
"If you can upload a file, you can build an agent like this today."

---

## IF TECH FAILS

**Stay calm. Smile.**

"Alright, we're having a live demo moment. This is WiFi at a conference venue."

**Play backup video:**
"Let me show you what this looks like when it runs smoothly..."

**After video:**
"The point stands: if you can upload a file, you can build this. Instructions are in the slide deck."

---

## EXERCISE 3 TRANSITION (After demo)

"Here's how you replicate this tonight:
1. Download Claude Code—free at claude.ai
2. Create new project
3. Copy the instruction set (it's in the slides)
4. Upload your first messy speaker packet
5. Done.

Now, turn to your partner..."

## HUMOR BEATS (Use these naturally)

**When showing messy bio:**
"'Dynamic thought leader who leverages synergies.' This reads like a Mad Lib written by a corporate intern at 2am."

**When showing missing tech requirements:**
"Three weeks from now, I'm getting an email: 'Hey, do you have a confidence monitor? Also, I need a standing desk. And a specific brand of sparkling water.'"

**When showing name mismatch flag:**
"That's the kind of detail a human would miss at 11pm when you're uploading 47 headshots and half of them are named 'IMG_1234.jpg.'"

## TIMING REMINDERS

- Setup: 2 min (don't rush the scenario)
- Upload Jane: 1 min (show the mess, get laughs)
- Instructions: 2 min (highlight banned words list)
