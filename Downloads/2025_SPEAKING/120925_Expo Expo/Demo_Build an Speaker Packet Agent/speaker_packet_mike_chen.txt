NOTES FROM EVENT COORDINATOR:
Headshot filename doesn't match speaker name - file is "speaker_photo_2024.jpg" but should probably be renamed to mike_chen_headshot.jpg for our asset library. Also need to confirm if he prefers "Dr. Michael Chen" or "Dr. Mike Chen" or just "Mike Chen" for name badge and mobile app.
