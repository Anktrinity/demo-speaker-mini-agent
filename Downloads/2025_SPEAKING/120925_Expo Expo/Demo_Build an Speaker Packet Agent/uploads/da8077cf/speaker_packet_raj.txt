SPEAKER INFORMATION FORM

SPEAKER NAME: Raj (just Raj)

BIO:
Raj is a unique voice in the world of... let’s just say experiences. A mix of creative technologist, accidental producer, and self-described “event alchemist,” Raj’s journey defies a clean CV. Roles? Fluid. Brands? Some big ones. He once built a 7-minute immersive thing for a launch party that broke Twitter for 11 minutes (allegedly). Raj prefers audio bios over written ones and is not into bullet points.

SESSION TITLE: TBD but something cool

SESSION DESCRIPTION:
It’s a vibe. Imagine walking into a room where the space talks back. Where the participant is not passive but gets pulled into a shared performance. The session will not be recorded. Attendees must surrender their assumptions at the door.

TECH/AV REQUIREMENTS:
- Sound is critical
- Projection mapping?
- Will bring custom gear
- Needs setup time (2 hrs min)

DIETARY RESTRICTIONS:
NA but prefers to eat after

TRAVEL INFORMATION:
Flying in from Barcelona via Reykjavik, arrives night before

EMERGENCY CONTACT:
@safemode (IG DM best)
