Okay, I need to give some instructions to Repl.it for some of the changes that I need to the UI. One, I want to make sure that I change the project progress overall competition to be on top of the Slack integration segment, right after where we see total tasks completed overdue due today, because on a larger screen, it looks weird if it's to the side of it, because there's all this white space that is being not used. Then the next step, the next update is when a brand new user with a new email is signing up for the demo page. One, where do I see as an admin, where is the CRM? As an admin, I need to be able to have a place where I can track who signs up, who lands on that sign-up page, who moves into signing up, and what steps do they take once they're inside. If I need to connect my GTM to it for Google Analytics, I can do that. Step three, there is a typo here in the Slack integration under the beta testing focus. I want that text to change to thank you for being a beta tester. We are testing the course Slack integration. After installation, feel free to try backslash task and backslash new demo task space to verify the system response in your workspace. That's where the typo is, between the task to verify, there is a typo. Then, if I am a brand new user signing up with a brand new email, the dashboard should be clean. There shouldn't be anything there from recent tasks, from previous tasks, from anything that we have been testing. For me, it's okay to have that on because we're running tasks on our site, but a brand new user with a brand new email should have that dashboard brand new. Then, the last thing, this is a logical question that I have for you. I'm ready to deploy this as a beta testing into a group of about 900 people on Slack. My question is, how will they use this if there is no clear deadline or a clear outcome? As a group that is not necessarily working on a common goal, how will they use it and test it in a group? Because we are only connecting it to one workspace. That is a question for us to figure out. What will that user use it for so we can give them the right tool and make sure that this demo is successful?
